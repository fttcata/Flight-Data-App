# Flight-Data-App
A flight data App made in Processing.org that allows the user to check flights from a data of 100k flights from the USA. 
The user can access the following things:
- Check diagrams sorted by distance, duration and destination/arrival airports
- Use the search bar to instantly access the diagrams mentioned in the previous point
- Move between the diagrams using "Next" and "Back" buttons.

 *** Important ***
 This project was made as a 8 week assignment for the module "Programming Project" that takes place in the first year of Computer Science at Trinity College Dublin.
 NOTE: The changes made for the project, such as adding diagrams, categories, search bar, were all made in a week, as this assigment had different new tasks every week.
